I know I have not posted anything since February of this year. There are a lot of reasons for that, but the biggest reason is I was in the middle of finishing my Masters Thesis. It was one of the most academically challenging things I have done in a while, and I am pretty happy with the results. I will be uploading and writing about some of the results in their own respective articles when the time comes.
