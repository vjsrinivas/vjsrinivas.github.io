Well, its been overdue but here are the two main papers to come out during my time in the program. </p>\n<p>The first link is to my main thesis, which focuses around the topic of running neural networks in embedded devices. These networks were benchmarked for speed, task performance, and resource use. The second link is to the IEEE paper that was published in late 2022. This paper is basically a subset of my thesis plus additional experimental data focusing on the heartbeat and respiration rate estimation of the system.</p>\n<div class=\"topic-list\">\n    <div class=\"topic-item\">\n        <img src=\"post-res/graduate_works/omgthesis.png\" alt=\"thumbnail showing two men excitedly pointing at a flow diagram\">\n        <div class=\"topic-content\">\n            <a href=\"https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_gradthes/7034/\"><h1>Benchmarking of Embedded Object Detection in Optical and RADAR Scenes</h1></a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/thread.css\">\n<div class=\"topic-list\">\n    <div class=\"topic-item\">\n        <img src=\"post-res/graduate_works/ieeepaper.png\" alt=\"thumbnail showing two men excitedly pointing at a flow diagram\">\n        <div class=\"topic-content\">\n            <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10046315\"><h1>Portable Real-Time System for Multi-Subject Localization and Vital Sign Estimation</h1></a>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>","created":"Thu, 11 May 2023 19:45:28 GMT","excerpt":"In one of my previous blog posts, I stated that I had sucessfully completed my masters thesis and would post more about what I did.
