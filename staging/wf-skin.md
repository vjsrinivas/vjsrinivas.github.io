What once was dominated with algorithms like Viola Jones, the area of face detection has expanded since the popularity of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) took off in the early 2010s. Tremendous effort from research organizations in collecting and assembling vast amount of data and crafting benchmarking competitions have allowed CNNs to tackle object detection problems with high accuracy. At the same time, there have been documented cases of [AI bias](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-bias.html), in which NNs have had trouble generalizing attributes about certain groups of people.

This article looks at the composition of a particular face detection dataset - WIDERFACE - to see its skin color composition and compare the performances of different CNNs under certain subsets of WIDERFACE.

## Introduction
[WIDERFACE](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/), which is part of the "WIDERFACE Challenge" by the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Multimedia Laboratory, is a popular dataset when trying to solve the face detection problem. The dataset is composed of
