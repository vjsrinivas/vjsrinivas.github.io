Typically, pen plotted art is very methodical and full of very percise patterns. The most common kind of pen plotting machine is the XY pen plotter, which draws onto a piece of paper with some kind of pen/marker/brush. Gcode instructions are used to guide the plotter to the proper positions on the paper. 3D extruder-based printers also operate in a similar way but in an additional (Z) dimension. Could you convert one to a XY pen plotter? \n","readingTime":"5 min read","mediaPath":"post-res/pen_plot/pen_plot_thumb.png","author":"Vijay Rajagopal","tags":["art","other"],"art_credit":"Vijay Rajagopal"},{"title":"Pseudo-LIDAR Projection via Depth Maps","slug":"pseudo_lidar","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 2024 19:45:28 GMT","excerpt":"In many navigation and layout applications, there is a need for spatial data.
